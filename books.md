## About My Books

[My books](https://edizionimigliori.com/product-category/books/martha-books/) are step by step “how to do it” manuals.  

They start with instruction on learning the basics of a certain technique and continue with some original exercises and short excerpts I have gleaned from a number of other technique books.  Finally there are passages from actual pieces that use the technique.  This way, before even playing the pieces, the hardest places are already learned!  

Taken as a whole, the books contain a distillation of what I have learned about teaching the cello from my own great mentors and more than 50 years as a performer and teacher.

All my books are now published by [Edizioni Migliori](https://cellobooks.net), which is run by my former student [Ahanu Banerjee](https://ahanu.info). You can purchase them [directly from the publisher's website](https://edizionimigliori.com/product-category/books/martha-books/); international shipping is available.
